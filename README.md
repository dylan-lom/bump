Schedule local notifications

Why
---

I sometimes find myself wanting time-sensitive reminders, but in a less abrasive
way than a traditional 'alarm', for example:

* Bus is approaching stop in 10 minutes
* Guest is arriving in approximately 2 hours

Since these events aren't super time-sensitive and can normally be inferred
without a time reference, I wanted to circumvent the procedure of creating an
alarm/stopwatch and actually dealing with it when it goes off (ie. fumbling in
my pocket and swiping left/right).

Something like that yeah
